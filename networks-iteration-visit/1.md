After talking to you the other day, the best way moving forward is to get you to see an assorted array of tools at a medium depth to get you better acquainted and more comfortable with technology.
Rather than learn concepts, were going to go straight into tools. Youre not expected to use them in the future, but all strategies used in these tools are used elsewhere.
This will expose you to terminology for better communication. Further, it will allow you to have a better mental model and demistify what happens behind all the abstractions.

Instructions: For EACH of these tools, you should be able to explain the following:
1. How does it work?
2. How would YOU implement it yourself at a high level? Write a long description or talk to me about it.
3. I want you to get lost in each tool. Have fun with it. This is going to get you better acquainted with  networking tools overall.
4. Complete the objectives.
5. Every day, we will talk about what you learned and youll have to go one layer deeper into understanding each tool.

## Tool 0: Routers, Hubs, Switches
Objective: Sniff out packets on the network.
[hubs, switches, routers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ofjsh_E4HFY)

Describe as precisely as possible what the difference is between Hubs, Switches and Routers.
Youre currently connected to a WIFI network. Explain what the topology probably looks like.
Download Wireshark, attempt to explain some of the traffic that is going on.

  * a **Router** routes packets between two or more networks
  * a **Hub** sends traffic to all computers attached to it
  * a **Switch** sends traffic to the destination and only to the destination, _if_ that destination is connected to the switch.
  
The router connects the Internet to a switch or a hub. The hub sends data over it's cable to everyone else connected. Say the hub is connected to a switch - the switch doesn't just send everything it receives back to everybody connected like a hub does. Instead, the switch looks at each individual packet's Media Access Control (MAC) address which corresponds with a specific connected computer, and it sends the packet to these computers only. https://kimrosea.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/internet-monitoring-lan-hub-switch.png 


## Tool 1: Tor/Darknet/Darkweb
Objective: Download Tor and understand how you would safely buy illicit equipment off the darknet.
Things you must be able to explain to a layman.
* `Encrypted traffic`: 
* `Proxy servers`: essentially a 'middleman' assigned to send and receive messages for you
* `VPNs`: VPN establishes a 'tunnel' between the two firewalls that's encrypted, and the traffic going to/from the remote network is tunneled through the VPN tunnel so you're physically somewhere else, but logically on the network.
* `Tunnels`: a virtual connection where data packets are encapsulated and sent over.

## Tool 2: VPN
Objective: Use a VPN to switch IP to another nation. _I used tunnelbear_
We have talked about the OSI model before, but did not go into specifics.
Describe each layer in detail.

**OSI model**

Layers are in desc. order:

1. __Physical__: The physical layer, the lowest layer of the OSI model, is concerned with the transmission and reception of the unstructured raw bit stream over a physical medium. It describes the electrical/optical, mechanical, and functional interfaces to the physical medium, and carries the signals for all of the higher layers.
2. __Data Link__: The data link layer provides error-free transfer of data frames from one node to another over the physical layer, allowing layers above it to assume virtually error-free transmission over the link. 
3. __

## Tool 3: NGROK
Objective: Expose your local web server to someone else on the public internet.
How does NGROK accomplish what it does?
How can this help you in your development process?


## Tool 4: uTorrent
Objective: Understand how distributed systems work.
How does uTorrent work? How do P2P things work overall?
Do you understand upload, download speeds etc etc?

##Tool 6: MBP
Objective: At EACH of the following hardware components, attempt to understand how they LOOK on the motherboard, what CABLES are used, how the FIRMWARE works.
[Macbook Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/15-inch) - Explain every component listed. Why is it beneficial at a lower level? How does each piece of hardware contribute to better performance?


##Tool 5: Bitcoin
What the fuck is bitcoin? Why is it considered to be distributed?

##Tool 6: Cloudflare
What is cloudflare? Whats so amazing about it.
Who are some of cloudflares competitors and compare them.


Extra mission:
Set up an AWS ec2 instance ALONE -- explain what you are doing at each step.
Download a linux distro and run it on VM

#Resources you should watch and should talk to me about over food.
[hubs, switches, routers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ofjsh_E4HFY) - can you explain how we are connected to the internet?

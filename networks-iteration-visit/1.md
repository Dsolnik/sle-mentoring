After talking to you the other day, the best way moving forward is to get you to see an assorted array of tools at a medium depth to get you better acquainted and more comfortable with technology.
Rather than learn concepts, were going to go straight into tools. Youre not expected to use them in the future, but all strategies used in these tools are used elsewhere.
This will expose you to terminology for better communication. Further, it will allow you to have a better mental model and demistify what happens behind all the abstractions.

Instructions: For EACH of these tools, you should be able to explain the following:
1. How does it work?
2. How would YOU implement it yourself at a high level? Write a long description or talk to me about it.
3. I want you to get lost in each tool. Have fun with it. This is going to get you better acquainted with  networking tools overall.
4. Complete the objectives.
5. Every day, we will talk about what you learned and youll have to go one layer deeper into understanding each tool.

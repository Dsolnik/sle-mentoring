#Things assigned to SLE:
* Rewrite what we ahve so far using the module pattern
* Learn about closures, by completing FEM - Fundamentals to Functional
* 

Extra:
* Learn about Node
* Parallel v. Concurrent
* AMD vs Commonjs vs RequireJS


#General Checkup
0. How are you dealing with time?
1. How was it to code using vanilla JS?
2. What was DOM manipulation like? - Is there a motivation for JQuery?
3. What do you think about Node?
4. What data structure is the DOM?
5. $(function(){
    
    })?
6. Talk to me about hoisting.
7. What is event bubbling? Why is this important?
8. Prototypal Inheritance - talk to me about it - why does everyone say everything is an object in Javascript?

##Collaborative Coding
Create a basket module and explain to me what is happening.
addItem
getItemCount

#Gen Lecture
* Answer any questions
* Lets discuss the difference between client-side and server-side rendering.
* Talk about the asynchronous model
* Talk about blocking vs non-blocking

#Iteration 3 Thoughts (HTML/CSS Slides, Event Loop Explained, Codepen Collab)
- Hook up NodeJS, ExpressJS, with your current application -> Create the API and host it yourself.
- Memorize the array functions - .forEach, for loop, for of, etc
- Need to definitely improve basics of HTML/CSS centering, positioning etc (NO BOOTSTRAP YO)
- Watch Philip Roberts talk
- Quiz on all array functionalities, Review on basic concepts (iteration3  or iteration4)
- What is the tradeoff on adding a method on the prototype instead of on the actual object itself?
- Talk about temporal dependency
- How does module.exports work inside Node?
- Node error-first callback pattern
- Codewars problems

#Iteration 4 Thoughts
- Hook up a database and generate the API dynamically
- Basics of Computer Science and Data Structures  (stacks and queues) -> because they are very array friendly
- Design Patterns Expanded (Software Construction)
- ES6
- go over select interview questions that test fundamentals

#Iteration 5 Thoughts
- Lets start making this shit pretty
- Revisiting clientside rendering

#MT
tell me about javascript
* functional
* oop
* event-driven paradigm
* single-threaded usually
* concurrent

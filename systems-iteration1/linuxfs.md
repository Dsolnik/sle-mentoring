This iteration focuses on using your current knowledge to tie into the linux operating system.
Were going to focus on the fundamentals needed to operate efficiently.

0. What are the 8 sections of the man pages? After this, attempt to use the man pages to  look up any commands I mention.
1. What is the difference between Linux, Unix, POSIX? How are they related?
2. Go to / in your mac computer -- compare the output to / in your Digital Ocean droplet. Do they look alike? Why is this?
3. Where does MongoDB store its configuration files? 
4. "Everything in Unix is a file" is a common quote amongst the smart. Go to /proc on your droplet and find out why. Hint use $ps
5. First navigate to each of these directories and attempt to define what they do. Then deny or confirm your hypothesis with the googs.:
    * /etc
    * /proc
    * /bin
    * /dev
    * /var
    * /boot
6. run $ls -la what does rwxrwxrwx stand for?
7. When you run chmod 777 what are you effectively doing? Why do we use the number 7 for max permissions? For whom does each rwx apply to?
8. What is the PATH variable? Put the output of your OWN path variable here. How does it relate to /bin?
9. What is apt-get ? (Run this command and try it out)
10. in the context of UNIX what do these characters mean? & (we used this):
    1. $

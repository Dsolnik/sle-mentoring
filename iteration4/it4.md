#Part 1 - Project
So now we understand how to hook up a button to make real network requests. By doing this, we got to explore how APIs on the net work as well as the different types of requests. 
We also got to refactor our code to utilize some of Javascript's most fundamental features.

This iteration we're going to be looking a little bit more into the technicalities behind networks and what really goes on underneath any connection. Then were going to attempt to prettify our project a little.

##Questions to answer before proceeding.
1. What is a cookie?
2. On Chrome, open up your inspector, hit the Resources tab. There you will see the following three crucial items:
    * Local Storage
    * Session Storage
    * Cookies
    Poke around and attempt to find out what these things are. Then do some research on them and write them out as done in iteration 3,2,1.
3. What is hashing? (10 words max)
4. What is encryption? (10 words max)
5. Choose between Google Login or Facebook Login.

Watch the following vids -- be ready to get quizzed on it as well as all the past iterations.

##Project Improvements
1. Implement SSO with the choice in number 5 above.  - Some things to note -- when doing this, only use the tools we've touched on so far. That is, Node, Express, Bootstrap(see point 2), async.js.
if you have the time continue with the other things below.
2. Download Bootstraps Grid System (ONLY THE GRID, no other assets).
3. ATTEMPT to implement GrubHubs fixed header with your button being on the top right. 

#Part 3: JS Tools
1. Do some research on ReactJS, what is the philosophy behind it? 
2. What is a build system? 



#Part 4: Extra Credit (To Come... more research on networks)

#Overview
This mentorship is going to focus first and foremost on your ultimate goal -- that is to rapidly create prototypes.

Having gone through this process before, web application development via Javascript is the safest and most efficient bet in being able to do so. The rationale being that the same abstractions and mechanisms that are in play in the web are ALL prevalent regardless of what layer of the stack you are working with.

In each iteration of the project we'll explore the most fundamental concepts of Javascript and how to rapidly prototype applications by using Javascript in doing so we'll cover each layer of the tech stack lightly and focus on mastering one.

#Iterations
We're going to continuously and gradually build up a prototype that will ultimately turn into a full-fledged application.

We'll see as we go that as we put more and more features onto the application, that we inevitably will have to use new tools to simplify our life, but aim to neglect the tools until needed.

#Project
We're going to recreate GrubHub incrementally. More deets to come.
